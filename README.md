Hey, This is Ahmad Amin. 
This is my another new Website created using php backend. The whole front-end design and back-end coding is done by me (+ some help from internet). 
Technologies that I used:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3/SASS
3. JavaScript
4. smoothproducts javascript for smooth animations
5. PHP (For backend programming)
6. My SQL (for database query handling)

So, you can see that It is a whole package of Full Stack Developement (frontend + backend coding). You can download the code and con run it on any PC, just read the instructions carefully to run it succesfully
Some images of the website design are attached below:
